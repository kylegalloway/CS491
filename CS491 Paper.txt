Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication

  I. Weaknesses in single text based passwords
    1. Encourages weak/memorable passwords & same passwords in multiple places
    2. Based entirely on aptitude of user
    3. Can be too restrictive (i.e. No spaces or special chars)
    4. Security vs. Usability

 II. How Multi-Factor Authentication has helped
    1. Overview of something you know, something you have, something you are method
    2. It reduces the risks of weak/memorable passwords & same passwords in multiple places
    3. It takes some of the burden off of users
    4. Still can be restrictive
    5. Security vs. Usability
    6. Bad things (Lost phone, stolen fingerprints, etc)

III. Future of Authentication
    1. Single Sign-on
    2. Replacement of Text based passwords w/ Biometrics (no burden on users)
    3. Furthering the something you know, something you have, something you are method
